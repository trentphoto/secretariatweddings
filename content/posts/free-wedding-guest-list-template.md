As you begin your journey of planning your wedding, one major task (a daunting one for many couples!) is to create a guest list. 

It can be tough: finding a good balance.

A balance between your desire to invite everyone you know and love —

Vs not going crazy over budget.

For many couples, this is time-consuming and often challenging.

That's why I created this free wedding guest list template.

It will allow you to arrange your guest list and keep track of RSVPs — to help make this task a little bit simpler for you.

## Why use a template for your guest list?

Quite simply, because you have a million things to think about and this will make your life easier.

Using template to create and manage your guest list will help you keep track of all the important details about your guests without you having to keep track of it mentally. (Or worse, not track it at all).

It’ll also make it easier to communicate with them as your special day approaches. You’ll be able to easily reference their name, contact info, status of their RSVP, etc. 

Think of it as a central location for their contact information and RSVP status.

Looking to ensure you stay within your budget? A guest list tracker like this one will give you a clear and accurate record of all the guests you’ve invited, as well as who has RSVP'd, with which you can adjust your budget accordingly as you go through the planning process.

Staying organized and on top of all the various tasks and aspects of planning, is seriously underrated. It will help you have so much more peace of mind leading up to your wedding day!

## Why a Canva template?

There are so many wedding planning templates online. But Canva is one of our favorite tools for this. 

You can simply bookmark the page, and continuously edit the template as needed, downloading anytime you need.

## About the Template

The template has several distinct components, including:

### 1. Contact Information

Include the names and phone numbers of all of your visitors in this area. Their name, address, phone number, and email address can all be recorded here.

### 2. Relationship

Describe each visitor's relationship to you or your partner in this area.
    
Use this to organize your guest list by priority. It will also help you decide who to invite to various activities (such the rehearsal dinner).
    
### 3. RSVP Invitation Status

Keep track of each visitor's status here. Record if you have issued invitations to them and if they have accepted them.

Additionally, you can use this box to mention any specific needs for accommodations, including dietary restrictions or accessibility needs.

### 4. Number of Guests

Specify the max number of guests that each invitee may bring in this field. This is crucial if your venue's capacity or finances are both constrained.

### 5. Notes

This part can be utilized to make any notes or remarks about every visitor, like any unique requests or requirements.
