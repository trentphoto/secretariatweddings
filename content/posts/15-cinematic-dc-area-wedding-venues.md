## What makes a cinematic wedding venue?

When choosing a wedding venue, there are the typical factors: overall aesthetic and style, the look and feel of the venue, options offered for catering and coordination, how many guests can be accommodated, and more.

But there are also factors that will influence how your photos and video will look too.

In other words, how beautiful the venue will look on camera.

So what are some factors that go into a venue that looks cinematic and stunning in photos and video?

First, indoor vs outdoor makes a big difference. Both are good - but you should know which look you are going for.

Indoor venues can be beautiful - as long as they are well-lit. A dark, dimly lit reception ballroom won‚Äôt make for the best photos. On the other hand, a room with large windows like the St. Regis hotel (#8 on the list below) can make for beautiful lighting.

Another consideration is location and scenery outdoors. Are there beautiful nature scapes surrounding the venue? Or maybe it‚Äôs tucked away in a beautiful garden area, such as Meadowlark Gardens (#5).

And if **drone videography** is important to you, you‚Äôll want to pick a venue outside of most major cities and away from any airports, as these will be a no-fly zone for drones.

## Before booking a venue

It‚Äôs great to talk to your planner as well as photographer and videographer before booking your venue. You can often get feedback as many vendors may have worked with some of these venues in the past. Often, vendors can share their experiences or their photography or video of the weddings they‚Äôve done at the venue you are considering.

If you already booked the venue, no worries - your wedding team will still be able to talk with you about your venue! (Although if you already have a venue, I‚Äôm not sure why you are reading this particular post)‚Ä¶ üòÖ
